Hi there! We are Avocado and Sloth, a couple studying Web Development and living in Ottawa, Canada.

Avocado is usually sold in supermarkets at a price of $5 for two. Oops. Wait a minute. Something goes wrong. Let's load again.

```
const Avocado = { 
    name: "Tiffany",
    gender: "female",
    identity: "global citizen", 
    roles: ["creator of the blog", "head chef"],
    languages: [
        { name: "English", level: "Fluent" },
        { name: "Mandarin", level: "Fluent" },
        { name: "Cantonese", level: "Fluent" }, //not as good as Sloth
        { name: "German", level: "Intermediate" }, //almost forget
        { name: "French", level: "Beginner" }, //A2 in Duolingo
        { name: "Japanese", level: "Beginner" }
    ],
    hobbies: ["Cooking", "Theater", "Plants", "Pokemon", "Reading others' blogs"]
};
```
